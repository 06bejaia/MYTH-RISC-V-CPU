# MYTH-RISC-V-CPU

Intoduction to RISC-V CPU arcchitecture:

RISC-V is an ISA, so it doesn't talk about how to implement the actual design. CPU designers take the ISA as their input and decide how to implement hardware (almost always) in RTL. In this day a single cycle design of the ISA will be implemented named MYTH. MYTH will become pipeline in the next day. Here is a schematic of the design
